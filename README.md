# neural-network-aimbot
neural network aimbot using yolo and cv2

# How does it work?
All this program does is, it tries to identify any on the modules it was trained with (people) on the screen view (the litle pop-up that shows the bot's vision) and when it does, if the aimbot is "online" it will lock the mouse in the person's head and wont let you move the mouse untill the person dissapears from it's view range or you press p to make the aimbot go "offline".
That's litterally it :)

# Setting up
1) Download all the available files in this repo
2) Download the other files at https://www.mediafire.com/file/jsynnwfm1hb8p8j/yolov3-tiny.weights/file
(if the link no longer works, please open an issue)
3) Place the file you just downloaded inside the modules folder
4) You are ready to go :-)

# Usage
- Use P to stop and resume the aimbot (pause the mouse locking)
- Use Q to quit
- Works on any game that allows 3rd party inputs
- Have fun ;)
